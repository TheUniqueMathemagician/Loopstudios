## My process

- Analyzing first HTML structure
- Stylizing the different parts of the project (first the texts then the design itself and finished by the sizes/positions)
- Adding the hovers on the elements that needed it
- And of course testing the code as the user at every steps of the precendents part of the process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

```css (grid)
.proud-of-this-css {
  position: relative;
	margin-left: 163px;
	margin-right: 163px;
	display: grid;
	grid-gap: 27px;
	grid: auto / repeat(4, 1fr);
}
```
Js:

The js you can see on that project wasn't from me because i didn't learn anything of Js at that point

### Continued development

I need to continue using grid in css, and integrate Js that I'll learn in the future
